# Setting Up Redux!

## Dependency

1. Redux

2. react-redux

3. redux-promise  
   "teaches" dispatch how to accept promises, by intercepting the promise and dispatching actions when the promise resolves or rejects.

4. redux-thunk  
   "teaches" dispatch how to accept functions, by intercepting the function and calling it instead of passing it on to the reducers.

> redux-promise와 redux-thunk는 redux를 조금 더 잘 쓰기 위한 도구이다.
